            <p>If you are a member of the Sancta Maria College school community, you have likely encountered the points system in some way. As it has been
                introduced only recently, many people may find it confusing, or they may simply resent the system. If you wish to better understand the 
                points system, this article is for you. In this article I will be giving a general overview of what the points system is, its purpose,
                its benefits and flaws as well as the improvements we have seen so far as a result of it. <br><br>
                
                The first thing I would like to mention is the purpose of the points system. The points system is a transparent disciplinary system which 
                rewards students for good behaviour, while sanctioning bad behaviour. You are given points when you perform well in an area of school life, 
                and deducted points when you fail to abide by the school rules. Each student’s points are visible on the VS Ware portal, which can be 
                accessed by parents and teachers. This allows students and their parents to view their points in real time. This gives parents a general idea
                on their student’s performance and behaviour at school.<br> <br>
                
                A huge benefit of this system is the transparency of it. When a student is deducted points, the reason must be clear and they must be made 
                aware of it. There are several categories of behaviour for which students can be awarded or deducted points, with more categories assigned 
                for awarding points. Another benefit is that it promotes good behaviour. Students will generally feel more encouraged to be more involved 
                in classwork and to participate in school activities, as they will be rewarded. The points system also allows for clearer boundaries
                between good and bad behaviour, and gives students more clarity on the punishments they will receive. Due to an increase in clarity 
                surrounding discipline, the points system can also improve the relationship between students and teachers, as it gives teachers an easy way 
                to enforce rules in a transparent way. Classes can be more constructive as there is clear punishment for misbehaviour, so conflict between
                students and teachers is easier to avoid punishment for misbehaviour, so conflict between students and teachers is easier 
                to avoid. <!--They Missed A . here, and reapeated "so conflict between students and teachers is easier to avoid" twice--> <br><br>

                A flaw of the points system, which was much more evident when it was first introduced, is that there can be a lack of consistency around 
                how points are given. Students often complained that teachers never failed to deduct points for bad behaviour, but some students would not 
                be given points despite making a strong effort and producing high quality work. The school addressed this and added more categories for good 
                behaviour, and has proven to be more successful. The points system’s aim is not purely to sanction students. It is designed to be as an 
                incentive for good behaviour, and to make discipline more transparent. <br> <br> <!-- Still is a lack of consistency around how points are 
                given. Students never "complained that teachers never failed to deduct points for bad behaviour". -->
                
                In conclusion, the points system is a transparent disciplinary system aimed to encourage good behaviour. Teachers can deduct and award
                points with a much stronger focus on fairness and clarity than ever before. If you remember one thing from this article, make it the fact 
                that the points system was not created to punish students or to make their lives more difficult. It simply aims to encourage good behaviour 
                and to create a more constructive and positive school environment. <!-- This article fails to answer the question asked in the title. The Title
                should be changed to an explanation into why its here and how it works. It is not a transparent system, much of it is hidden like average points
                per house for example, good reasons for some of this though. If you have come across this I'll answer the titles question, No the points system
                has not been succesful. Earning and losing points is not clear and is often unfair for different indidivduals. --> <br><br></p>
