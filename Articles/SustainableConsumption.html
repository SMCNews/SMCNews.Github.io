            <p>In today's world, there is a constant desire to keep up with the latest trends. We need to buy more, consume more at any cost... But is
                this right?<br><br>

                As part of my Politics and Society leaving cert project, my group surveyed senior cycle students on their consumption of fashion. We were 
                surprised with our results. People admitted they shopped primarily from online shops like Shein and Aliexpress along with Pull and Bear, 
                Urban Outfitters and Zara. These clothing brands are known to be unsustainable. <br>
                We were happy to find out many people donated their old clothes to charity or gave it to friends and family. Still a shocking 30% of students 
                unsustainably dispose of their clothes. 18.2% of students surveyed say they don't even care about being a sustainable consumer of fashion! 
                While 59.1% of students think that they are a good sustainable consumer. <br><br>

                These results depict the harsh truths of reality. Education is so important especially on a topic as nuanced as this. Please keep an eye out 
                for our poster campaigns throughout the school, as they will help inform and educate you. The sustainable development goals have a wonderful
                website called ‘Wardrobe Change Campaign’. Which have podcasts available for those who wish to learn even more. This is a worldwide problem, 
                but don't be fooled, change can start from you!
