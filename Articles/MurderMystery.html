                Written by Charlie Reilly<br>
            </p>
            <p>The following article is a creative writing piece made by transition year students explaining the twists and turns, dark forces that ceased
                the life of our beloved principal. <br><br>
                
                Sancta Maria College’s annual Science Week was brought to an unexpected halt when principal Dr. Aine  Moran was murdered between 3 and 8 p.m 
                on November the 12th. Detectives from an Garda Síochána identified and made not one but two arrests. The suspects in question were found out to 
                have been Mr.John Paul Teirnan and Mr. Richard Berkeley.The two men were arrested in their classrooms before being escorted off the premises to a
                waiting Garda car by Sergeant Davitt on the 16th. <br><br>

                Berkeley was a staff member at Sancta Maria College at the time of the murder. It was revealed that Tiernan posted a hitman advertisement on 
                the dark web. This advertisement was answered by Mr. Berkeley who needed the cash due to nefarious dealings on the Totally Toys website. <br><br>
                
                The motive for the crime seems to have been a number of controversial requirements imposed by Dr. Moran on the Spanish teacher such as not
                being permitted to enter the school unless wearing a sombrero hat and being referred to as Juan Pablo. <br><br>

                The arrest was made possible by the tireless work of students at Sancta Maria College and a team of forensic experts from Garda Síochána.
                Forensic investigations were held at 1pm on Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday leading up to the arrests. <br><br>
                
                Crucial evidence was found incriminating Berkeley such as vomit containing protein found at the crime scene, fingerprints and navy fibres from 
                the clothing worn by Berkeley that day. <br><br>

                Multiple communications were found between Berkeley and Tiernan on both suspects' personal devices. Berkeley quoted that the whole thing was a 
                “miscarriage of justice” while Teirnan claimed he would “do it again” and the Deputy Principal would be next. The Deputy was not available for
                comment. <br><br>

                We all hope that these two men will receive the appropriate punishments for murder and that such an unfortunate event does not occur at Sancta 
                Maria college ever again.
