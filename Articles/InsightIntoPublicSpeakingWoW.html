            <p>The public speaking WOW is loved by our students at SMC.The WOW Class is a chance for people to debate about things, learn about interesting
                topics and to speak about what they believe in. There are two groups in the class: our debate team who get the time to prepare for the next
                debate and the rest who will do group activities but sometimes they join together and do one big group activity.
            </p>  
            <p>We had an Interview with Mr. Connaughton, the teacher who leads the Public Speaking WOW class. We asked him a few questions and here
                is what he said.
            </p>  
            <p>According to Mr Connaughton, he started the Public Speaking WOW because he had an interest in it and wanted to give students a chance to express 
                their feelings on a topic and to have a place where they can talk. His goals for this club are to win debate competitions and to make everyone 
                happy. He said face to face communication is important since it is something we use in everyday life and this WOW Class may help your confidence.
            </p>  
            <p>In almost every class they get to have debates that <!--I added the word that -->could be serious such as environmental issues or something fun 
                like pineapple on pizza. Participants have the chance to act out something like winning an oscar or giving a speech about our school. All the 
                students seem to be very happy with this  club and have a good time when they are there.
            </p>  
            <p>Big thanks to Mr. Connaughton who has been hosting this wow class every term.
