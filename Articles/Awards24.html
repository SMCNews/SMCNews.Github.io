                <div>The awards ceremony</div>
            </div>
            <p>In an unprecedented display of duration and quantity, this year’s school awards ceremony has set a new record for being the longest and 
                most populated with accolades. Yet, beneath the surface of this seemingly celebratory event lies a growing sentiment of discontent and 
                disillusionment.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the procession of awards continued to unfold, it became increasingly clear that the ceremony was less about genuine achievement and 
                more about the distribution of what many students are calling ‘participation trophies.’ The sheer number of awards has diluted the value 
                of recognition, leaving many to wonder if the accolades serve any purpose at all.
            </p>

                Critics argue that the time spent in the auditorium, applauding the endless parade of recipients, could have been better allocated to 
                academic pursuits, especially with exams looming on the horizon. The ceremony, intended to motivate, has ironically achieved the opposite 
                effect. Students have expressed that the motivation to strive for excellence has been undermined by the knowledge that awards seem 
                predestined for a select few, often perceived as ‘teacher’s pets,’ rather than earned through merit.
            </p>
            <p>    
                This year’s ceremony has sparked a debate about the true cost of over-awarding. Is it merely a harmless celebration, or is it a misguided 
                endeavor that wastes precious time and fails to inspire the student body? As the school community reflects on this event, it is clear that 
                a balance must be struck between recognition and redundancy, between celebrating achievements and fostering genuine motivation.
            </p>
            <p>    
                The question remains: How can we honor true accomplishment without falling into the trap of awarding for award’s sake? The answer may lie 
                in reevaluating the criteria for recognition and ensuring that it is both meaningful and merited. Only then can we restore the integrity 
                of the awards ceremony and its role in encouraging academic and personal growth.
