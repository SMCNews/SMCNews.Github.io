            </p>
            <p>This October, our school welcomed five visiting French teachers to our school. They all teach in Le Mans, in the school famous for Formula 1
                cars <!--Le Mans is famous for GT racing though, where has this information come from-->, (Lycée Le Mans Sud Polyvalent). <br>
                The purpose of their trip was to see how we teach in Ireland and to experience how we incorporate so many diverse interest areas into our
                curriculum. They had a particular interest in our TY and LCA programmes, our moderate learning, ASD and sensory classrooms, The Well, our 
                technical subjects such as Home Economics, Woodwork, Technical Graphics, DCG and Science. They visited many classes and also many businesses 
                in the community and source work experience for some of their students who will come to Ireland in January-February 2024. It was truly a 
                great experience for both of the school communities to share perspectives and ideas. Before they left, one of our journalists, Ms. Lucy Hague,
                interviewed two of the visiting teachers for this newspaper on October 25th 2023. <br><br>

                Q: Yasmina and Pascale, what was your favourite part of the Erasmus experience in Sancta Maria?<br>
                A: (Pascale): “My favourite part was the tour that the students did with us on our first day as we got to see the school from their point
                of view. This was a really great experience as we got a real sense of the belonging that the students have from being a part of the
                school and how happy they were. We would like to bring this to our school. We talked about this together after the school day on
                the first day and we all thought the same thing.” <br><br>

                Q: What surprised you the most about your stay here?<br>
                A: (Yasmina): “I think that the students are given the chance to be autonomous in this school. Also, the respect that the students have 
                - particularly with students that have extra needs - for the other students in the school. We couldn’t get over how [sic] students would 
                help each other out, students were so respectful to teachers and this worked in tandem - the teachers are very intune with their students. 
                It was a true eye opener and we found a very big difference in learning than our more formal...maybe distant? approach. <br><br>
                
                (Pascale): “Leur zenitude - they are in exam mode but it wasn’t as stressed as in France...they were preparing for their midterms, but 
                instead of the teachers being ‘shouty’ and inducing stress, they were revising together. It was refreshing to see.<br>
                Also, the amount of technology we saw. So many students have devices that are used in every class we see. We do not have this! <br><br>

                (Yasmina): “...also I noticed that the students are used to working in groups and how to organise themselves - the teachers did not need 
                to repeat it ten times what to do - the students are used to it...” <br><br>

                Q: If there was anything that you would bring from your school in France to our school, what would it be? <br>
                A: (Both Pascale and Yasmina): “A canteen and time to eat it. We noticed how the teachers and the students don’t really take too much time 
                for eating their lunch and we would find this hard. We always have a lunch with a starter, main course and dessert. Our pupils don’t
                appreciate it too much, but we think that it is good that this is provided for them by the state. There is also a morning club for breakfast
                for our students and this can be good for those that don’t eat breakfast before they leave the house.” <br><br>

                Q: Pascale, I believe that you were here in this school before in a different capacity?” <br>
                A: (Pascale - smiling sheepishly!): “Yes, as a language assistant to Ms. Pauline Moran back in the...let’s not talk about how long exactly, 
                but let’s just say that some of the teachers were on the other side of the classroom when I was here...I have some of the best memories from 
                my time in Sancta Maria and this week has just proven that I was not only seeing “La Vie en Rose” - it truly is a magical and special place.<br><br>

                Yasmina and Pascale, thank you for taking the time to talk to me before you leave again for France.
