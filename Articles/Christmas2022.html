            <p>During the end of the Christmas term, the school held end of term event’s. <br><br>

                Sancta Maria College had a very festive Christmas period, which included Christmas Jumper day, Christmas doors and of course the end of 
                term Ceremony. <br><br>

                To begin the Christmas season, the TY students were tasked to decorate doors for each subject they studied. There was a huge amount of 
                creative design, which made it very competitive. <br><br>

                It wouldn’t be Christmas without Christmas jumpers. Students arranged a jumper day, this where people who wish, can wear a Christmas jumper
                instead of the school jumper. Most, if not all students and staff could be seen with their jumpers. <!-- Yea, their school jumpers --> <br><br>

                And to end Christmas the school held the end of term ceremony, where they highlighted everything like student of the month. <br><br>
                
                The house Teach Aoibhneas, won a trip to the Galway Christmas Markets. They won this as they were the house with the most points. The 
                Senior Prefects and Student’s of the Months, also got to go on the trip, to acknowledge their hard work over the term.
