                Principles Taking On Their Roles
            </p>
            <p>The highly anticipated Addams Family TY musical cast was released a month ago, after the rigorous selection process for the cast. 
                Marina Rice (Director), Marian Gill (Producer), Judi O’Malley (Head Choreographer) and Felicity McElroy (Musical director) made 
                the final decision on the cast. And to say the least, this musical is one you should not miss. <br>
                This musical is set on the hit 1991 film, directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Jonathan Schoenig will be starring as Gomez Addams alongside 
                him will be Patricia Power as Morticia Addams. Sean Staunton as Uncle Fester, Martha Weston as Grandma, Joy Fallon as Wednesday 
                Addams, Kevin Bracken as Pugsley Addams, Cormac McNamara as Lurch , Oscar O Morain as Mal Beineke, Danielle Cox as Alice Beineke and 
                Douglas O’Toole as Lucas Beineke. This musical will be staged on the 24th, 25th and 26th of March (Times will be announced sooner to 
                the time). Preparations are well underway, with the cast having started rehearsals a few weeks ago. Our Transition Year students are 
                also starting their work on all elements of the production of the musical, as well as working hard on dances. The stage management team 
                this year are Amber Walsh (Stage Manager), Erin Fadden (Assistant Stage Manager), Ruby McAleer and Helena Graeml as Team leaders. This 
                musical is guaranteed to be different from others, it will be full of Frights, Laughter and Tears (of happiness we hope).
