            <p><br>On Wednesday the 18th of October, we took part in a dress up for Halloween. The atmosphere was electric throughout the school. Those who 
                dressed up got the chance to take part in a competition for best dressed, exciting each student. To dress up every student donated two 
                euros to Cairde Caher (Childcare in Louisburgh). Our photographer gathered and took some lovely photos of everyone on that day.
