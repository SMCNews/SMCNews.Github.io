            </p>  
            <p>Grace advice for writing a book is to most importantly keep breathing, be mindful, let your creativity flow, re-read your treasured books, and 
                analyse the reason of your partiality towards them, connect with your favourite authors and lastly to join a creative writing class, to have a 
                community to support and encourage you.
            </p>  
            <p><b>Symbolism</b><br>
                The unusual name Paper Lanterns symbolises the teenage years. Paper - the amount of knowledge it can gather, how impressionable it is, and yet
                paper is a reminder of natural growth, it can be made from trees, bamboo, cotton and plants. Even the largest trees grow and flourish from a small
                seed.<br>
                Lantern - Fundamentally, the lantern provides light. The act of igniting a fire is a tale as old as time, and so is the journey from teenage 
                hood to adulthood. Light in its context helps lead the way and pushes aside the surrounding darkness. Where the long path before us is useless 
                without the glow of a lantern to show us the way. The adolescent years will always be an illumination in your memories.
