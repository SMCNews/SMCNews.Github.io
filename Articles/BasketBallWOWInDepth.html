            <h2>Basketball W.O.W. In Depth</h2>
            <p class="NewsDate">

            <p>Basketball is one of the most popular W.O.W. (Well-being on Wednesday) activities offered in the school, and basketball is liked for a reason. 
                It offers: fun, a workout and a chance to mess around with your friends. Basketball teaches skills, teamwork and allows people to have fun 
                playing against each other learning good sportsmanship which is needed. The teacher that supervises basketball, Mr Reihill says that “the 
                basketball W.O.W. is going great and that nearly 30 people are coming in every week”. He also says that “he hopes to enter the teams to 
                national and regional competitions next year,”. He says that “they get to play matches almost every single week and they also help teach people
                how to play basketball”. <!-- This paragraph was repeated twice in the newspaper --> <br><br>
                
                We interviewed a member of the Basketball W.O.W., Brajan Tanski, about his thoughts on the W.O.W. He says “I enjoy it, but I would like to
                play in the gym a little bit more,” This is understandable as wet clothes and basketball aren't exactly a good match. Another member, Vaughan 
                Campbell, agreed with Brajan’s opinion on playing in the gym. It is clear that the basketball players feel they need to play indoors more. 
                Vaughan is pleased about the fact that the school is taking priority in students' wellbeing and allowing us to do these activities, which
                we can all agree on. <br><br>
                
                Having over 30 students every week can make creating fair teams somewhat hard, but there are some different groups, such as the junior group 
                and the senior group, so no need to worry about getting smacked halfway across the court by a fifth year that didnt see you! The teachers 
                will allow you to join whichever group you want, but try to make an educated guess about where you belong.
