            <p>SMC hosted a wonderful talent show this year and everyone had the chance to show off what they could do: singing, playing the piano or
                anything you can think of. It was run by our school prefects and was held on December 21st. Students had the chance to win prizes and eternal
                glory.
            </p>  
            <p>Auditions were held on the 20th of November and judges were delighted with the variety and high standard of talent. There was a great line up 
                for the final, which was held in the PE hall. A full sound system and lights were hired to ensure the event was enjoyed by everyone.
            </p>  
            <p>First prize went to the school band, ‘School of Rock’, which gave a wonderful rendition of The Cranberries’ Zombie with second prize going to 
                Luke Heraty for his excellent version of Bohemian Rhapsody, with third prize going to Sean Staunton for his performance of a well known country 
                ballad. Well done all!!

                <!-- Add also a brilliant perfomance of Teenage Dirtbag by 6th years as a bonus separate from the competition -->
