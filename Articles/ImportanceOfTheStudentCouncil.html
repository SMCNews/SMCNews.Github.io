            <p>I had a conversation with my fellow classmate today about daily school in Sancta Maria, and I put out a question on who they ask for advice 
                about school, and who they turn to when there're <!--This said there are--> issues in the school community that they believe need to be 
                changed. The answer I got was simple, short and sweet: a shoulder shrug from them. <br><br>

                This response from them immediately set off some thinking in my head, but it didn’t take long for me to realise there’s already a solution: 
                our student council representatives. <br><br> <!--Really?-->

                Following the election in this school year, I think it’s important to start spreading awareness about the work that the student council 
                does. <br><br> <!--That would be none. Also an election where you cant vote doesnt sound like an election-->

                Some might assume that a student enters the elections for the accolade, but really, it’s a chance to take responsibility and represent your 
                year group and class. It's a chance for<!--it saif change to t the--> the students’ voices <!--There was no to here -->to be heard. <br><br>
                
                I think normalising discussing our issues with our representatives is absolutely the way to go this year, and since the student council’s 
                job is to improve the school, we should definitely start communicating with them, because they always try their best to take a pragmatic
                approach to solving our issues.
