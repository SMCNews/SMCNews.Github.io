            <p>On Thursday the 24th of November, a Careers fair was held in Sancta Maria College. It was a great opportunity for students and parents 
                to see what options are out there for students once they finish secondary school.
            </p>  
            <p>This was an event in which many different colleges, courses and people from lots of different careers attended to give information to 
                students, a place where students were able to ask questions and talk to people with advice on where they should go after finishing school.
            </p>  
            <p>It included information on colleges such as NUIG and Hibernia college, people from different career paths such as teaching, medicine, law 
                and many more and other options such as apprenticeships.
            </p>  
            <p>The volunteers were open to questions and very knowledgeable, what a great opportunity for everyone involved.
            </p>  
            <p>Many Students and Parents attended the Fair, it was an enjoyable experience for all who attended.
            </p>  
            <p>Thank’s to Ms Gill who organised the whole event. It was a great success! And we look forward to more events like this in the future.
