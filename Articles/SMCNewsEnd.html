            <p>It's time to say goodbye to SMC News, our school newspaper. While it might not have 
                been the most popular read, it did provide a platform for many students to express 
                themselves and share their stories. Created by a team of students, the newspaper 
                brought us updates on school events, sports highlights, and interesting articles 
                about our peers and teachers.
            </p>
            <p>The website, SMCNews.github.io, made by another student, will continue to host all 
                the past articles, ensuring that the efforts of the SMC News team won't be forgotten.
                 While the newspaper may not be missed by everyone, it's important to acknowledge the 
                hard work and dedication that went into producing it.
            </p>
            <p>So here's to SMC News and the students who contributed to it. Even if it wasn't 
                always the most exciting publication, it still played a role in our school community.
                 Goodbye, SMC News, and thank you for the memories.
